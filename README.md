# Project Setup, Docker Build, and Usage Guide

## Overview

This repository provides a Python application consisting of `main.py` and `repl_client.py`, and supports containerization via Docker. This guide will help you set up the environment, build the Docker image, and run the application.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system (for running in a container).
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (if running locally outside Docker).

---

## 2. Running the Application with Docker

### a. Build the Docker Image

From the root of the project directory, run:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
```

This will create a Docker image named `my-python-app`.

### b. Run the Docker Container

To start the application in a container, use:

```bash
docker run --rm -it my-python-app
```

- The default command in the Dockerfile will execute the main application.
- If you want to run a different script, you can override the command. For example:

```bash
docker run --rm -it my-python-app python repl_client.py
```

---

## 3. Running Locally (without Docker)

### a. Install Dependencies

If your application has dependencies, ensure you have them installed. If there is no `requirements.txt`, check `main.py` and `repl_client.py` for imports and install as needed, e.g.:

```bash
pip install requests
```

(Replace `requests` with any modules used in the code.)

### b. Run the Application

To run the main application:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run the REPL client:

```bash
python repl_client.py
```

---

## 4. File Descriptions

- **main.py**: Likely the primary entry point of the application.
- **repl_client.py**: A related client or tool, possibly for interactive or remote use.
- **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions to build a Docker image for the project.

---

## 5. Customization and Configuration

- If your application requires environment variables or configuration files, add information here or create them before running.
- You can modify the Dockerfile or add a `.env` file as needed.

## 6. Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for improvements or bug fixes.

## Appendix: Sample Dockerfile (for reference)

```dockerfile
# Use official Python base image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy project files
COPY . .

# Install dependencies if requirements.txt exists
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Default command
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with Python dependencies, ensure you have all required modules installed.
- For Docker-related errors, make sure Docker is running and you have sufficient permissions.
